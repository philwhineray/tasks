Lack of app credential should produce a message

google task interface class
 - re-order

bulk import

when we complete something with recurrence from command line,
does it still recur?

mass process of e.g. Inbox
 - assign lists
 - assign tags
 - add notes

task editor class
 - read/write text file
 - * |xxxx| Details [tag] [tag] @YYYY-MM-DD

Questions:
  when re-ordering a subset, how do we account for tasks that were
  in-between in the full list?
